### Project Overview
In this project I write a version of my resume in JavaScript (my complete resume can be seen on my linkedin found under my bio), following a mock design picture (design-mockup.png). In this project I display basic JS syntax, which includes manipulating data, building loops and creating functions. At the same time it also displays some simple jQuery DOM manipulation methods. Files in which I had a hand in writing are helper.js, index.html.
